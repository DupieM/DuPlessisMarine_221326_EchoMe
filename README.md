<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* `Expo` was used to create a native Android app
* `OpenAI` was used to get responses from AI based on questions asked
* `Webview` was used to open my repository links in the app

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Engineering my prompts to make sure that the AI will respond based on my academic journey and creative identity
* Making it possible for the user to select the chat function and then based on the journey milestone where they are currently at form an automatic question on the Chat screen

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Interfacing with OpenAI in two different ways as I have two types of  questions towards AI
* Interfacing with the chat screen to display the journey card text in a question format for the user when clicking on a button

### Reviews & Testing
<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->

#### Unit Tests

`Unit Tests` were conducted to establish working functionality. Here are all the tests that were ran:

* `Test 1` of confirming that displaying of journey data on my cards are correct
* `Test 2` of confirming that the chat function works for when user type a question on the journey tab to answer according to who I am
* `Test 3` of confirming that the chat function works for when user is on Ask anything tab that lets them chat with a normal AI request
* `Test 4` of confirming that the hobbies display in dropdown box and populate card below
* `Test 5` of confirming that the chat function below the hobbies card work to chat about my hobbies
* `Test 6` of confirming that the link to my online portfolios and display on the web screen view are working

#### UAT Tests

`User Acceptance Testing` were conducted to establish working functionality by my peers.

* `Peer One` did a unit test of the whole app and helped me by pointing out how to fix my UI designs to make it more user friendly
* `Peer Two` did a unit test to test if all the functionality was working perfectly.
* `Peer three` did a unit test to test if all the functionality was working perfectly.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* To implement Firebase storage for my hobbies that is displayed as to easily update content
* Linking my projects that is talked about in my journey to my showcase screen for that specific project
